# 🧠 Sentiment Analysis with Go Emotions Dataset

This project performs **multi-label sentiment analysis** on Reddit comments using the **Go Emotions** dataset developed by Google Research. It applies Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Machine Learning techniques to classify text into 27 fine-grained emotions such as joy, anger, sadness, and surprise.

## 📁 Project Structure

- `sentimentanalysis.ipynb` — Jupyter Notebook containing all steps:
  - Data cleaning and preprocessing
  - Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
  - Emotion classification using machine learning
  - Evaluation and visualization

- `go_emotions_dataset.csv` — CSV file containing labeled Reddit comments (Go Emotions dataset).

---

## 🔍 Key Features

- ✅ Text preprocessing with NLTK (tokenization, stopword removal, lemmatization)
- ✅ Emotion frequency visualization (bar plots, word clouds)
- ✅ Multi-label classification (some comments express more than one emotion)
- ✅ Model evaluation using accuracy, F1-score, confusion matrix
- ✅ Ready-to-run in Jupyter or Google Colab

## 📊 Dataset Description

The **Go Emotions dataset** is a human-annotated dataset of 58,000+ Reddit comments, labeled across 27 emotions + Neutral. It’s designed for multi-label classification — meaning a single comment can express multiple emotions.
